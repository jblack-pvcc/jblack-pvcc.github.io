    <h1>Misinformation</h1>

    <h2>What is Misinformation</h2>
    <p>In an age with information all around us as a result of developing technology, people can easily create false information without proper oversight. And with enough distance between us and the falsehood, we can be unaware if it is actually true. With a lack of basic knowledge on computer technology, people might get tricked into dishonest beliefs. And with the speed that misinformation can spread makes it hard to fight. Studies have shown that it takes about 10 times more time for true information to reach people before false information does (Vosoughi, Roy, & Aral, 2018).</p>
    <h2>How Computer Technology Affects Misinformation</h2>
    <p>The invention of the internet and the prevalence of devices to access it has led to more people getting access to random information about the world. While now we can access factual information more easily through the internet, most do not go out of their way to check the validity of what they see on social media.</p>
    <h2>How Misinformation Affects Democracy</h2>
    <p>Unless people know about topics related to current legislation or events related to political figures, they have to rely on news or social media to get their information. On top of that, political information especially is very important to a lot of people. These two things make political misinformation easy and very widespread. Clear thinking is an essential part of democracy in order for power to be trusted in the hands of the people. </p>
    <h2>Company Involvement in Misinformation</h2>
    <p>To prevent the spread of misinformation, it is necessary for social media companies to try to fact check information posted on their site. But companies have figured out that posts that make people scared and angry cause them to stay on the site longer. Recently both Twitter/X and Meta have put out statements saying that they would no longer try to fact check information on their site. Getting yourself to fact check information and leave the cycle of doom scrolling is one step, but it would be better to insure that nobody else gets pulled into misinformation on these sites.</p>
    <h2>Media Literacy</h2>
    <p>When people rely on social media, they follow along the broad movements of society and are then discouraged from so-called lesser more reliable information sites that they value. With the popularity of social media increasing, a single person's capacity to delude others increases. Not to mention, much of technology is a product, and so has a profit incentive. These business models reward quick sensational information over slower intellectual information.</p>
    <h2>How to Combat Misinformation</h2>
    <p>I think everyone in a democracy should be willing and able to search for correct information on their own, and itâ€™s also important to have good journalism. Articles and studies should be easy to find and understand so if anyone wants to educate themselves on a subject they can. Basic cybersecurity and media literacy classes in school would be useful in enabling everyone to find the truth on their own.</p>
    <h2>How Should We Educate Ourselves About These Dangers</h2>
    <p>One effective way to combat misinformation is by educating people about it while they are in public school. Educating them about how to find reliable sources would give them the tools to investigate suspicious claims on their own. Teaching them to recognize bias would be important for understanding the purposeful spreading of misinformation.</p>
    <h2>How Will Our Fight Against Misinformation Look in the Future</h2>
    <p>We rely on technology for most of our information but this has also made it simple to add false information to the internet. What we will have to do now is to educate people and to invent technology to recover from the problems we made through the information revolution. Sites that collect news articles on a subject and that show bias on different articles will become very useful tools going forward.</p>
